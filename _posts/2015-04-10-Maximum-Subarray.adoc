Problem Statement
-----------------
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


My Approach
------------
1) If all integers are negative, then return the greatest number from the array.

2) If all integers are positive, then return the sum of all integers in the array.

3)If integers are positive and negative both then: 
Initialize variables : maximum_till_now(keeps track of the maximum sum at any point) and
